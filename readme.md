Description
-----------

This plugin provides a series of procedures to facilitate some scripting
tasks, including some basic features that are inexplicably missing from
the scripting API (toLower, toUpper, split, ...).

The plugin also includes methods for:
* batch renaming of objects in the Objects list
* safely creating temporary files and directories
* free manipulation of date strings
* safely running dubious code (as in a try/catch block)
* smart and customisable tracing and logging of a script's progress

Requirements
------------

* None
