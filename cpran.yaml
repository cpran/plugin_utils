Description:
  Short: a collection of basic utilities to facilitate scripting
  Long: >
    This plugin provides a series of procedures to facilitate some scripting
    tasks, including some basic features that are inexplicably missing from
    the scripting API (toLower, toUpper, split, ...).

    The plugin also includes methods for:
    * batch renaming of objects in the Objects list
    * safely creating temporary files and directories
    * free manipulation of date strings
    * safely running dubious code (as in a try/catch block)
    * smart and customisable tracing and logging of a script's progress
